=======================What we cover in the class 1======================
- Setup(Anaconda, environments, vscode, colab, .py, .ipynb)
- Static type variables
=======================
- Python is a dynamic language which set the type of variable on runtime according to the value assigned in it. 
- agr kisi command main start main - ho to system us ko as a flag consider kry ga e.g -n, -l, -a or system recognize -la as -l, -a
- agr kisi command main start main -- ho to system us k agy likhy hoay keyword ki value ko search kry ga e.g --version 
========================What's new in python 3.12.0
- static type
    - Before python 3.12, when we define a variable then type of variable is assigned on runtime. The disadvantage is that during 
    program execution if type of variable will change because of reasigning of variable then it may give errors. To resolve this issue,
    in 3.12 when we define a variable then set type of variable as well. Intellisence of mypy is available for .py but not in .ipynb for now.
    - if you want to check that there is no any type variable issue use the command "mypy file_name.py" it will show error and line numbers
    - Agr koi function value string main ly raha hua or variable main during execution koi or type value assign ho gai to function main jaty
    hi program crash ho jay ga. Is sy bachny k liay static type use ho gi k program k baad "mypy filename.py" sy ap check kr skty hain k variable
    main during program execution koi or value to ni assign ho gai.
